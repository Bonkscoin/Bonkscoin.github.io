About Bonk
What Is Bonk (BONK)?
According to the one-pager, BONK is the first dog-themed coin on Solana "for the people, by the people" with 50% of the total supply of the cryptocurrency airdropped to the Solana community. BONK is similar to Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) memecoins, it was launched on December 25, 2022, and led to an increase in the price of the SOL token (a rise of 34% in 48 hours). Trading began on December 30, 2022, arousing genuine interest from the crypto community.

The main goal of the team is to bring back liquidity to Solana-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The idea of the developers was to create a full-fledged community coin that will be used across all the dApps built on Solana, and each user will have the opportunity to become part of the ecosystem, "where everyone gets a fair shot".

BONK was airdropped randomly to Solana NFT collectors, developers, and artists, other airdrop details remain unknown. Currently, the project has a small digital footprint on the Internet, except for an active twitter account.
